  <h1>Mastery-Based Grading System</h1>
  <p class="small">This system is designed to prioritize learning, iteration, and conceptual understanding over point-chasing.</p>

      <h4>Next steps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Start the assignment as soon as possible</li>
        <li>Come to office hours early (this course is cumulative)</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Revision and Late Submission Policy</h3>
  <p>Programming is cumulative: falling behind makes later topics harder. At the same time, unlimited late work becomes unmanageable. The policy below is designed to balance both.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h4>Standard deadlines</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Assignments are due on the posted due date/time.</li>
      <li>Work submitted after the deadline is considered <strong>late</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Grace period (automatic)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>48-hour grace window</strong>: you may submit within 48 hours after the deadline with no penalty.</li>
      <li>Use this for occasional life surprises; do not plan around it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Late passes (limited)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Each student gets <strong>2 late passes</strong> for the semester.</li>
      <li>A late pass extends the deadline by <strong>7 days</strong> (beyond the grace period).</li>
      <li>To use a late pass, email me <strong>before</strong> the original deadline with the subject: <code>CS1 Late Pass – [Assignment]</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Hard cutoffs</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No submissions are accepted more than <strong>7 days</strong> after the due date unless a late pass is used.</li>
      <li>No submissions are accepted after we have moved two units past the assignment (or after solutions are discussed in depth in class).</li>
      <li>End-of-semester cutoff: all work must be submitted by the date posted on the course calendar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Revisions for Level upgrades</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If you receive Level 1 or Level 2, you may revise within <strong>1 week of receiving feedback</strong>.</li>
      <li>Revisions must specifically address the feedback; do not simply resubmit the same work.</li>
      <li>Some revisions may require a brief check-in to confirm understanding.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Why this system benefits you</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focus on understanding</strong>: you spend time learning, not negotiating points.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth is rewarded</strong>: early mistakes are not permanent.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear pathway</strong>: Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 is a structured improvement process.</li>
  </ul>
