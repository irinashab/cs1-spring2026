    <h1>Lesson 4: More About Variables</h1>
        
    </header>
 <main>
 <p>In this lesson, we take a closer look at variables—not as fixed containers, but as values that can change over time.</p>
 <p>As variables change, programs must make decisions based on their current values, and the order in which updates happen becomes part of the program’s logic.</br>
Understanding how values change is the first step toward writing programs that can respond intelligently to different situations.</p>

<div id="footer-placeholder"></div>

<script>
  fetch("assets/includes/footer.html")
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(html => {
      document.getElementById("footer-placeholder").innerHTML = html;
    })
    .catch(err => console.error("Footer load failed:", err));
</script>
