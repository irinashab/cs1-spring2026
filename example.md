# Drawing Shapes in Processing

This is a simple guide to help you get started with shapes in **Processing**.

## Setting Up the Canvas

To set up the canvas in Processing, use the `size()` function. Here's an example:

```java
void setup() {
  size(400, 400); // Creates a 400x400 canvas
  background(255); // Sets the background to white
}
