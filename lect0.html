  <h1>Lesson 0: A Short History of Computing</h1>

  <h3>Historical Note</h3>
  <p>
    Today, we take computers for granted, but this was not always the case.
    In fact, the word <em>computer</em> originally referred to a <strong>person</strong>,
    not a machine. Before electronic computers existed, human “computers”
    performed calculations by hand for astronomy, navigation, engineering,
    and science.
  </p>

  <p>
    To better understand how modern computing emerged, explore the resources
    listed below and conduct some independent research of your own.
    Afterward, reflect on what you learned and share your thoughts in a
    detailed post.
  </p>

  <h3>Why this matters for CS1</h3>
  <p>
    Computer Science is not just about learning syntax or writing code that “works.”
    It is about learning how humans formalize ideas, build abstractions,
    make mistakes, revise their thinking, and gradually create reliable systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the figures you will encounter here struggled with incomplete tools,
    wrong assumptions, and limited technology—yet their ideas shaped how we program
    today. As you begin learning Processing and Java-style thinking, you will be
    engaging in the same iterative process: experiment, fail, revise, and improve.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection prompts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What impressed you most about the history of computers?</li>
    <li>Which ideas, inventions, or developments did you find particularly meaningful?</li>
    <li>Is there a figure in computer science who stands out to you as a “hero”? Why?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You may focus on a specific topic or person, but your post should be
    thoughtful and substantial—two sentences will not suffice.
    Be sure to cite your sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are also encouraged to respond to your classmates’ posts.
    Engaging with others’ perspectives often leads to deeper understanding.
  </p>

  <h3>How this is graded (mastery-based)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 3 (Mastery):</strong> thoughtful reflection, clear connections, cited sources, and meaningful engagement with peers.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> solid reflection but missing depth, clarity, or connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> minimal response or unclear understanding.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 0:</strong> no submission.</li>
  </ul>
